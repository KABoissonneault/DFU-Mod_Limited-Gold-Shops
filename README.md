Version: 1.00

DESCRIPTION:
All shops that can normally have items sold to them (besides thieves guild fences) now have a limited supply of gold that restocks every 15 in-game days after first being
entered. This supply of gold is determined by many factors, primarily being store quality, as well as rotating regional modifier. Stores can be invested in by the player to
increase maximum possible gold generated on restocking cycles.

WHAT DOES THIS MOD CHANGE AND WHY?:
-The economy in Daggerfall has quite the glaring flaw. That being every shop owner has a bottomless bank-account in which to buy all of your looted items, every single store
even the most run down one in the region. For me, this is a massive point of non-realism, in a game that has many aspects and ambitions of being somewhat of a simulation
of a fantasy sandbox. This mod aims to assist in fixing this problem, by giving every shop a limited gold supply, very similar to how it works in Morrowind.

-The player will now have to work more to get as much out of their loot cart hoard as possible. No longer can you dump 10 daedric katanas at the local run down general store
and come out a millionaire. Now you will actually have to visit multiple stores in order to sell your piles of loot, or wait a not insignificant amount of in-game time for those
shops to restock their gold supply. You may not even be able to get the most expected gold out of very expensive items, and instead have to settle for what the shop has left.

-With these added restrictions on selling loot, there is also a mechanic added in that will allow the player to "groom" shops that they use frequently in order to get more out
of each restock cycle. This mechanic being investment, if the player invests in a shop, a portion of that amount will be added onto every future restock for that shop, so the
more invested in a store, the more you can sell to that shop per-cycle before they run out of gold to buy your stuff with. So if you like a certain city or town, you can improve
the shops by investing in them, the return you will get from your investment is determined by many factors, primarily the quality of the shop, as well as the total amount invested.


SPOILERS/MORE DETAILS:
-Of the many things that effect how much gold is generated in a store, some other factors include: Player Luck stat, and player Mercantile skill, if the shop was invested in.

VERSION HISTORY:

1.00 - Initial Release


INSTALLATION:
Unzip and open the folder that matches your operating system (Windows/OSX/Linux)
Copy the "limitedgoldshops.dfmod" into your DaggerfallUnity_Data\StreamingAssets\Mods folder
Make sure the mod is enabled and "Mod system" is enabled in the starting menu under "Advanced -> Enhancements"

COMPATIBILITY:
###-This mod WILL CONFLICT with the "Inventory Filter" mod. You will still be able to use the filter mod in your normal character inventory screen, but
the filter will no longer be avaliable inside the trade window. To have this mod function with any other mod that overrides how the trade window works,
always have this mod "loaded last" which basically means have this mod as close to the bottom of the mod list as possible.

UNINSTALL:
Remove "limitedgoldshops.dfmod" from the "StreamingAssets/Mods" folder.
